Different modes defined in: vendor/libdw1000/src/libdw1000.c
Seems possible to create new modes, example format:
const uint8_t MODE_LONGDATA_RANGE_ACCURACY[] = {TRX_RATE_110KBPS, TX_PULSE_FREQ_64MHZ, TX_PREAMBLE_LEN_2048};
Mode used in src/uwb.c; called in dwEnableMode( );
Can also set smartPower mode and preambleCode in nearby functions
