PYTHON, from PC:
To fly, use the functions from cflib/crazyflie/commander.py. If you want to use the drone
without the beacons, you should use send_hover_setpoint with velocities, as this is the
best way to do things. With beacons, you have a choice to use send_position_setpoint or 
send_setpoint. Not sure what the main difference is, they both set position but they go to
different ports (COMMANDER_GENERIC vs COMMANDER); both work well with the beacons though.
	To receive data from the drone from your own port:
and then in cflib/crazyflie/__init__.py's run function, you can add code to check the 
packet data. We always put a code before our data (e.g. consolePuts("~@data")) and then used 
the data only if the packet had that code to filter out the other packets. 
C, firmware:
To send data from the drone to the PC, use consolePuts("insert string here"). We have made 
another C file called droneComm.c which enables droneCommPuts(), which will go to an unused 
port (CRTP_PORT_DRONE) which may be more helpful. This port is currently likned to the PC but 
we are planning to use this port to communicate between two drones. The file will also be 
modified to receive packets to that port soon.
