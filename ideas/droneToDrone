Ideas;

1. modify UART, use second set of pins, ...
2. try create new CRTP port(?) and hope that works

- Add packet send to the crazyflie2-nrf-firmware radio driver, main loop and syslink communication. Add the new syslink packet to the crazyflie-firmware project and use it. _arnaud

Files to look at:
-Crazyflie2NRF:
uart.c, 
syslink.c,
main.c,
-Crazyflie:
crtp.c,
queue.c,
syslink.c,
console.c,
commander.c

From python/PC side:
crazyradio.py, send_packet fcn; has data (but from radio dongle's ack)
