Current files which control positioning and location

*** NOTE: Bitcraze mispells 'aLtitude' as 'aTtitude'

- controller_pid.c
	- sets desired rates and adjusts setpoints
	- logs data (actuatorThrust, roll, pitch, yaw, rollRate, pitchRate, and yawRate) under the 'controller' group
	- uses sensfusion6, position_controller, and attitude_controller

- controller_mellinger.c
	- controller using PID based on a paper by Daniel Mellinger using 'minimum snap trajectory'
	- has its own internal PID control
	- logs lots of data
	- uses position_controller and math3d

- estimator_complementary.c
	- not quite sure what this is used for
	- is not adjusted for legacy coordinate system?

- estimator_kalman.c
	- estimates quad position and velocity in x,y,z plus the attitude error using a kalman filter (?)
	- note: magnetometer plays no part in estimation
	- contains estimator using tdoa (loco-pos) and using flow
	-- two are mixed together using the stateEstimatorUpdate* functions which call stateEstimatorScalarUpdate

- position_controller_pid.c
	- pid-based implementation of position commander
	- uses pid, commandar, and position_controller
	- seems to be a straight-forward pid implementation without use of attitude
	
- planner.c 
	- Sets current and future flight states based on trajectory
